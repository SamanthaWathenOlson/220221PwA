I am doing fine, questions I was asked during the interview were simple Java questions, like what is inheritance, Abstraction. I was also asked questions like what's 
the difference between Override and Overload, how to create custom exception and how to handle a exception as well as how to handle multiple exceptions, walkthrough my
project, what did I use to connect my frontend to my backend, and Multithreading (they were curious on how we handled multiple requests).
