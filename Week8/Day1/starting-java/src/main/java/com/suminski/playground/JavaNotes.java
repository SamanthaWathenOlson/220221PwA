        * What makes Java Java?
        *
        * Java is a high level programming language (memory management is handled for you)
        *
        * Java is a "compiled" language (ALL the source code is compiled first, then your code is executed)
        *
        * Java is a statically typed language: you must declare your variable types, they are not dynamically assigned
        *
        * Java is a strongly typed language: your data types will not be implicitly coerced into other types
        *
        * Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language: everything is handled by classes and objects
        *
        * Java is a "Write once, Run anywhere" language: as long as the computer has a Java Runtime Environment and Java Virtual Machine, it can run Java applications
        *
        * Java has a rich open-source community: there are many free libraries of Java code that you can utilize
        *
