        Your challenge is to find the number of even and odd positive numbers up to and including the given number.
        For example, if given the number 10, you should return first the amount of even numbers, then the amount
        of odd numbers on a single line, like this:
        5 5
        Do not hard-code your answers: the goal of this exercise is to help you become better at problem-solving,
        and to help you become more familiar with writing effective control flow.
