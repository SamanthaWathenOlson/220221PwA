        key value pairs. For example, the first new key added should be called key4, and its associated value should 
        be 4, then the next new key should be key5, its associated value should be 4, and so on until there are 10 key 
        value pairs following this pattern. Use console.log to check myObject has 10 keys with the appropriate 
        names and values to check your work. HINT: use string interpolation with back tics (``)
