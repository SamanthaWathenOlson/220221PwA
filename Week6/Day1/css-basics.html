    <!-- the example below is inline styling: this is when you have a style attribute that dictates the styling in line -->
    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: red;">I want this header to be red and centered</h1>
    <h1>this is going to be left aligned and yellow</h1>
    <!-- another way to stylize your element is to use a styling tag in the head -->
    <p>I want this paragraph <i>element</i> to be right aligned and green</p>

    <!--you can also get your css from an external css file-->
    <h3>this element recieves its styling from a css file that is located elsewhere</h3>
