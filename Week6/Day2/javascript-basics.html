    // Javascript is one of, if not the most,common client-side scripting languages. Also, due to modern technology, 
    // Javascript is becoming a more popular server-side technology due to software like Node.js

    // A few notes about Javascript:
    // Javascript is a high level language (memory management is automated for the developer)
    // Javascript is a multi-paradigm language: it can be written functionally or by following OOP principles.
    // Interpreted language: Javascript code is compiled and executed line by line
    // Case sensitive language: you should seperate your lines of code with ;
    // You can place Javascript inside your HTML file via a script tag, or you can link your JS instead

    // For more information, see the Javascript-basics.js file
